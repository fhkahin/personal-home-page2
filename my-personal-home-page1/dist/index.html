        <p class="c-section__text">
          I am a biomedical scientist by training, but my current role is that of a refugee case worker for a charity 
          that supports refugees and asylum seekers in rebuilding their lives and integrating into society. On a day-to-day
          basis, I assist clients in finding suitable colleges and community centres where they can learn English, 
          as well as helping them with their housing needs and providing them with independent information, advice, 
          and guidance. <br><br>

          As a refugee case worker for a charity that supports refugees and asylum seekers, my role is multi-faceted
           and involves a range of activities that are geared towards helping clients rebuild their lives and integrate 
           into society. One of the key aspects of my role is providing welfare support to clients so that they can
            access benefits and other financial support. Many of our clients are new to the country and may not be 
            familiar with the different systems and processes that exist. As a result, my job involves providing 
            guidance and support to help them navigate these systems and access the resources that they are entitled to. <br><br>

            In addition to my work as a case worker, I also have a passion for technology and am excited about the 
            potential for coding to transform lives. I discovered <strong>Code Your Future</strong> while researching services for 
            my clients, and I was thrilled to find an organization that aligns perfectly with my personal values and
             goals. Helping refugees and asylum seekers to rebuild their lives and integrate into society is something 
             that I have always wanted to do, and coding is my dream. <br><br>
             I am eager to learn programming and use my skills to make a positive impact in the world. I am committed to continuous 
             learning and development and excited to apply my transferable skills and experience as a refugee case worker to excel
              in the tech sector.

        <p class="c-section__text">
          I love technology because it can make our lives better, solve difficult problems, and help us grow as individuals.
          <br>What's most exciting to me is that technology is always changing and improving. There's always something new to learn and explore, which I find really interesting because I enjoy lifelong learning.
